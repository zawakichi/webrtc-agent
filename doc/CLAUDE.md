## Project Overview

This is a WebRTC agent project. The repository is currently in its initial state with minimal files:
- README.md: Contains basic project name and placeholder content
- LICENSE: MIT license for the project

## Current State

This is a new repository with only basic project structure. There are no source code files, build configurations, or development tooling present yet. The project appears to be in the early planning/setup phase.

## Development Setup

No build tools, package managers, or development scripts have been configured yet. Future development will likely require setting up:
- Package management (npm/yarn for Node.js, cargo for Rust, etc.)
- Build and test configurations
- WebRTC-specific dependencies and tooling

## Architecture

The codebase structure has not been established yet. This file should be updated as the project develops to include:
- Core WebRTC agent implementation details
- Module organization and data flow
- Key interfaces and abstractions
- WebRTC peer connection management patterns
